# [Strict CSV](https://github.com/Guiorgy/StrictCSV)

A recration of the CSV specification under much stricter guidelines to simplify parsing and serialization.

## C\#

This is a sample implementation of the `Strict CSV` format specifications version `0.1.0`.
It doesn't aim to be performant, but instead relatively small and easy to read/write.
